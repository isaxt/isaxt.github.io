    <h2> reflection</h2>
    <p> I originally wanted to do a similar “movement” as the example given to us (the face that expanded or shrank depending on the position of the mouse), but have a different face/character. That is why I had the sketches of the faces and then the two TokiDoki cactus characters. However, I was worried that it would be too similar to the given example and decided to pivot my idea to this cloud character that slowly expands as the user “collects” different “puffs”. The face of the cloud character also interacts with the user “poking” it, changing its facial expression. 

        I genuinely think I spend HOURS on this project. I think I was a bit too ambitious with this project– I had to consult multiple people and spend so much time iterating and debugging and watching tutorials/ going to the p5.js reference page. A bit of a nightmare…
        
        The user interaction makes the project more “fun”-- being able to move the mouse around and see the cloud character make different faces, collect more “fluff”, and restarting the entire experience is all very engaging. 
        
        There are still some “bugs” within the code, sometimes the [R], and [N] key doesn’t do their respective tasks, and if you let the program continue to run, the background will start to have these blue “dots” placed throughout– Im not sure why. I still need to figure these small components out, but overall I am happy with the current state of the project. </p>
