    <h2> reflection</h2>
    <p> Karen gave such a darling backstory to her object. I felt the nostalgia when I was reading her description. Her actual description of the character wasn’t too descriptive, but fortunately, I am familiar with the Rilakkuma bear so I knew what she was envisioning. When I read the last sentence, I thought of the “normal” bear character, just the brown bear with white and yellow characteristics. 
        I think that the image looks quite similar to the actual Rilakkuma character, definitely not EXACTLY the same, but I think the colors and overall shape of the image I programmed is a good “copy”. 
        The actual coding portion was a bit tedious when it came to the placement of all the shapes– like where the eyes should be and where should the mouth go in relation to the nose. It was a lot of trial and error to get the perfect placement (manipulating the numbers). 
        I was having a hard time deciding where/how to implement the blendMode(),Translate(), Rotate(), Push(), and Pop() components, because I had already “planned” how the bear would look using just primitive components. I eventually found alternate ways to manipulate my original code to include the different technical components. I think that for this specific application, using the translate(), push() and pop() components didn’t really elevate my work, but I think going through the different iterations and seeing to implement them/change my code to accommodate the requirements was good practice. 
        Overall, I am very happy with how this first sketch came out! It got to experiments with the placement of the 2D primitives, manipulate colors, and find ways to include the additional requirements into my code.
