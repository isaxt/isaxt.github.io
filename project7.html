    <h4> ORIGINAL GAME PROPOSAL: </h4>
    <p> I want to make a game that reflects my time in high school 
        (and my sister is currently in high school so also her time in 
        high school).
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in high school, I was juggling classes, schoolwork, work,
        extracurriculars, and spending time with friends outside of school.
         It was a time when I had to plan meticulously to maintain a balance 
         between all these aspects of my life. If I chose to neglect my schoolwork 
         and hang out with my friends, then I would either lose sleep or have to 
         catch up another time. That is what I want my game to focus on– 
         the decisions between academics and “having fun” and the consequences 
         of them.
    </p>
    <p>The game is first-person, as the user is the character/student
        and it is in their perspective. 
    </p>
        
    <h4> GAME DESCRIPTION:</h4>

    <p>The game's premise is based on making choices and decisions 
        during 3 days in a school week leading up to your graduation. 
        The character has 3 periods/classes that they attend. You can
         choose to avoid doing your homework and procrastinate by scrolling
         on social media, hanging out with friends, or playing video games. 
         The more you procrastinate though, more thoughts will crowd your 
         field of vision. The option to choose to not procrastinate will ask the
          player “are you sure” twice to further simulate how procrastination 
          feels and how it "drags you down". Choosing to do work will have the 
          player doing more things in the game, which will take longer because 
          it feels longer to do work than to procrastinate. </p>
    
    <h4> REFLECTION (AFTER MAKING THE GAME):</h4>
    <p> I actually enjoyed this project alot! 
        I was worried because I haven't done something 
        similar in terms of the coding multiple scenes and having 
        such specific interactions, but it was easily tracked with a few 
        variables and thankfully didn't take as long as I had expected. 
        In the math homework scene, I was worried about the circling part 
        and making sure that a circle appeared if you clicked an answer, but 
        to only have one answer circled at a time for a given question. For 
        the english homework, I asked chat gpt to generate a last chapter of 
        a book, and I think it was alright for the use of the game. I think 
        the game would have been more "powerful" or "stuck with the user better"
         if the game was longer and with more assignments throughout the week,
          but I am happy with where it is now.</p>
