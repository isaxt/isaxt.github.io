    <h3>Partner’s names: Claire Eo + Mehak Garg</h3>

    <h4> DESIGN PROCESS:</h4>
    <p> 
        I mostly tried to copy each of my respective groupmates’ sections as accurately as I could and integrate them in a “cohesive” way, like not having a floating head or very distinct breaks between the different parts, but as one “homogenous” being.
        
        Claire’s character’s backstory: A rabbit who fights crime. He has a big heart and his power comes from his love
        
        Mehak’s character’s backstory: Baymax from Big Hero 6 because it represents the power of tech and design in helping people improve their well-being. 
     </p>
     <h4> NEW BACKSTORY:</h4>
     <p>  In a futuristic world where animals and machines coexist, a scientist named Dr. Seraphine discovered a young bunny, Clover, badly injured in the forest after a tragic accident.
        
        Clover lost the use of his legs, and his future seemed uncertain. Determined to save him, Dr. Seraphine decided to rebuild Clover’s body using advanced robotics. Now equipped with sleek, powerful robotic legs and a white titanium body, Clover can hop faster and leap higher than ever before. 
        
        Clover uses his newfound strength to protect his fellow animals and explore the world, constantly seeking the balance between nature and technology.
        </p>
    <h4>  REFLECTION:</h4>
    <p>  Overall, this was a pretty fun assignment. I definitely had a *hard* time trying to manipulate everything and the order of how to print the different sections of the character, but it was ok in the end. I think if I were to continue working on this project– I would love to incorporate more interactive elements to the piece, just so there is more “fun” elements to the assignment.
