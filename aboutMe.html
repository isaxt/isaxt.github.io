    <p>i am someone who likes a wide range of things. 
        i like consuming media, whether that is art, poetry, movies, lectures...
         anything where i can listen or see and "take in". 
         before coming to design school, i was planning to go into nursing or 
         something biomedical, because i had a deep interest in learning about the body. 
         i have pivoted that interest into a desire to understand what makes good 
         design vs great design--the psychology behind it. it introduced me to uiux and 
         understanding design beyond function and aesthetics, but what keeps people 
         engaged.
